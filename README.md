# VBA_Analyzing-Data-Using-Macros

### In order to analyze large amounts of stock market data for multiple years (2014-2016), a VBA script was written to loop through each year of data, calculating the total stock volume each stock had over said year, with the total being displayed with the correct ticker symbol. Each year of data is placed on separate tabs, with the VBA script being able to loop through each worksheet with only being run once. 

### The raw data can be found in the excel file named Multiple_year_stock_data_AS, while the VBA code is saved as VBA_stock_data. Below are screenshots of each year of the results on the stock data.
